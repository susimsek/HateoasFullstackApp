The term HATEOAS stands for the phrase Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State.   
The single most important reason for HATEOAS is loose coupling.  
If a consumer of a REST service needs to hard-code all the resource URLs, then it is tightly coupled with your service implementation. Instead, if you return the URLs, it could use for the actions, then it is loosely coupled. There is no tight dependency on the URI structure, as it is specified and used from the response.
